# ✨ Sulat.ai ✨  
**_AI-Powered Letter Writing Companion_**

Sulat.ai is a simple but meaningful AI-powered web application designed specifically for **writing thoughtful, creative, and personal letters** — not chatting. Unlike general-purpose AI assistants like ChatGPT or DeepSeek, Sulat.ai is focused solely on **composing messages and letters**, with built-in settings to guide tone, language, and occasion.

## 🧠 Why Sulat.ai?

Sometimes we know exactly what we want to say to someone — but we can't quite put it into words. Or maybe we want to be creative and expressive, but language barriers or emotional blocks get in the way.

Sulat.ai is here to help.

This project was born out of a personal need:  
> _To turn emotions and thoughts into meaningful words — especially when it’s hard to start._

---

## 💡 What Makes Sulat.ai Different?

Other AI tools require long and detailed prompts. You need to tell them what tone to use, how long the message should be, and hope it understands the occasion.  
**Sulat.ai flips that around.**  
You just choose from intuitive options, and the app crafts the message for you.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Break **language barriers** — especially for users who want to write in **English**, **Filipino**, or a mix (**Taglish**).
- Help people who:
  - Want to be more expressive or sweet, but don’t know how.
  - Want to **consistently** write good morning or good night messages that feel fresh.
  - Need a message but have **no idea what to say**.

---

## 🔧 Core Feature: Smart Letter Customization

Users can set the **tone and structure** of their letter with:

- ✍️ **Message Type** (e.g., Good Morning, Romantic, Comforting, Professional)
- 🎨 **Tone Styles** (Romantic, Sincere, Poetic, Witty, Casual, etc.)
- 📅 **Occasion** (Birthday, Anniversary, Valentine's Day, etc.)
- 🗣️ **Language** (`English`, `Filipino`, or `Taglish`)
- 📏 **Message Length** (`Short`, `Medium`, or `Long`)
- 💖 **Enhancements** (Add a quote, make it poetic, heartfelt, or humorous)
- 🌈 **Visually Appealing UI** with dark mode and theming
