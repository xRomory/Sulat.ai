# Sulat.ai

A personal AI-powered message assistant built with **ReactJS (TypeScript)** on the frontend, **FastAPI** on the backend, and **PostgreSQL** as the database.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project is a focused, heartfelt tool designed to help users compose thoughtful and non-redundant messages for someone important in their lives. Whether it's a daily "good morning" note or a quiet expression of appreciation, this app serves as a supportive writing companionâ€”never replacing the intention behind the message, only helping to put those intentions into the right words.

Unlike general-purpose chatbots or AI tools, this app is designed **strictly for composing letters and messages**. It does not answer unrelated queries, perform general chat, or serve as a knowledge assistant. Its only goal is to help you say what matters in a meaningful, expressive, and emotionally aware way.

The application supports both **English** and **Filipino** languages, allowing users to craft messages in the language that best conveys their feelings. Built with simplicity, privacy, and intentionality in mind, it aims to be your quiet co-writer for the moments when words feel just out of reach.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

There are times when you know how you feelâ€”but not always how to say it. This app is for those moments. Itâ€™s not about outsourcing emotion; itâ€™s about refining it.
